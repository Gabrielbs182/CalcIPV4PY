# CalcIPV4PY

Intro:

calculator for the purpose of calculating the range of the subnet to which the ip is found, at first it only works with IPV4.

How to use:

The user will simply enter the IPV4 address and the Subnet Mask in the entries requested by the program and watch while the magic happens, 
as it exits the program will print the following information:

*IPV4 subnet address in decimal.
*Subnet address IPV4 in binary.
*Subnet broadcast in decimal.
*Broadcast the subnet in binary.

The version 1.0 of the calculator is part of an academic exercise, in future with new versions will be added a graphical interface and the 
code will undergo an optimization process.
